    "\n",
    "Answer:\n",
    "x contains a reference to a Circle object\n",
    "\n",
    "Explanation:\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, when you write x = Circle(), you are creating a new instance of the Circle class.\n",
    "The variable x does not store the object itself, but a reference (or pointer) to that object in memory.\n",
    "The other options are incorrect:\n",
    "\"x contains an int value\" (not true, x is not an int)\n",
    "\"x contains an object of the Circle type\" (not precise, it's a reference)\n",
    "\"Circle contains an int type\" (not relevant)\n",

    "val = Sales(123)\n",
    "print(val.id)\n",
    "Answer:\n",
    "123\n",
    "\n",
    "Explanation:\n",
    "\n",
    "When creating Sales(123), the __init__ method assigns self.id = id, so self.id is set to 123.\n",
    "The next line in __init__, id = 100, just reassigns the local variable id, but does not change self.id.\n",
    "So, when you print val.id, you get 123\n",

    "Question 3:\n",
    "The correct way to instantiate the following class is:\n",
    "\n",
    "Python\n",
    "class Dog:\n",
    "    def __init__(self, name, age):\n",
    "        self.name = name\n",
    "        self.age = age\n",
    "Answer:\n",
    "Dog(\"Rufus\", 3)\n",
    "\n",
    "Explanation:\n",
    "\n",
    "The __init__ method expects two parameters: name and age.\n",
    "Dog() would fail because it doesn’t provide those arguments.\n",
    "Dog.create(\"Rufus\", 3) is not valid unless you define a create class method.\n",
    "Dog.__init__(\"Rufus\", 3) is not how constructors are called in Python.\n",
    "So, Dog(\"Rufus\", 3) is correct."
